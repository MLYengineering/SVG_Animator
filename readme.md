# **ü§ñ SVG Animator AI**

Breathe life into your static SVG graphics with the power of AI. This tool uses Azure OpenAI to transform your text descriptions into complex, character-rich SMIL animations‚Äîright in your browser.  
Forget complex animation software. Simply describe the desired personality ("Make the robot look curious\!") and watch as the AI creates a unique, "Clippy"-style animation.

## **üöÄ Features**

* **AI-Powered Animation**: Converts natural language into complex SMIL animations.  
* **Creative Animator Mode**: The AI acts not as a mere code generator, but as a creative animator that builds personality and character.  
* **Complex Animations**: Generates chained and staggered animations that tell a short story.  
* **Advanced Technique Support**: Masters path morphing (animating the d attribute), transformations, and color changes.  
* **Interactive UI**: An easy-to-use interface built with Streamlit.  
* **Live Preview**: Instantly see the animated SVG within the app.  
* **Download Functionality**: Download the final, validated SVG file.  
* **Intelligent Error Correction**: Automatically cleans up common errors in AI-generated code to ensure compatibility.

## **üõ†Ô∏è How It Works**

The application combines a **Streamlit UI** with the power of an **Azure OpenAI language model**.

1. **Input**: You paste your SVG code and a text description of the desired animation.  
2. **System Prompt**: A specially designed system prompt instructs the AI to behave like a creative animator. It includes detailed rules for complex animation techniques and the correct handling of SVG structures.  
3. **API Call**: The inputs are sent to the Azure OpenAI API.  
4. **Generation**: The AI analyzes the SVG, interprets your instructions, and injects the corresponding SMIL animation tags into the code.  
5. **Cleaning & Display**: The result is automatically checked for common errors and corrected before being displayed in the Streamlit app and made available for download.

## **üèÅ Quick Start**

Follow these steps to get the project running locally in minutes.

### **Prerequisites**

* Python 3.8+  
* An Azure account with access to the Azure OpenAI Service.

### **Installation & Setup**

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/svg-animator-ai.git  
   cd svg-animator-ai

2. Install Dependencies:  
   (Create a requirements.txt file with the content below, then run the command.)  
   \# requirements.txt  
   streamlit  
   openai

   pip install \-r requirements.txt

3. Configure Environment Variables:  
   (This is the most secure method. Do not commit your keys to GitHub.)  
   **For Linux/macOS:**  
   export AZURE\_OPENAI\_ENDPOINT="YOUR\_ENDPOINT\_URL"  
   export AZURE\_OPENAI\_API\_KEY="YOUR\_API\_KEY"  
   export AZURE\_OPENAI\_DEPLOYMENT\_NAME="YOUR\_DEPLOYMENT\_NAME"

   **For Windows (PowerShell):**  
   $env:AZURE\_OPENAI\_ENDPOINT="YOUR\_ENDPOINT\_URL"  
   $env:AZURE\_OPENAI\_API\_KEY="YOUR\_API\_KEY"  
   $env:AZURE\_OPENAI\_DEPLOYMENT\_NAME="YOUR\_DEPLOYMENT\_NAME"

4. **Run the Application:**  
   streamlit run main.py

   Your browser should automatically open and display the application.

## **üí° Pro-Tips for Best Results**

* **Use IDs**: Give the SVG elements you want to animate clear and descriptive id attributes (e.g., \<g id="left-eye"\>...\</g\>). This helps the AI identify the correct parts.  
* **Be Creative, Not Technical**: Instead of "Rotate by 10 degrees," write "Make the head bob curiously." Describe a mood or a story.  
* **Iterate**: Not every animation will be perfect on the first try. Use the result as a starting point and adjust your instructions to refine the animation.  
* **Start Simple**: First, test simple animations on a single element to get a feel for how the AI responds to your instructions.
